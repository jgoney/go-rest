go-rest
=======

A simple REST server in Go. This is a personal project/proof-of-concept that was started just to explore Go in more detail. It's not even remotely close to being production ready, though you're free to play with it if you'd like. Pull requests are welcome as well.

Of interest here is the orm package, which is a rudimentary implementation of Django's built-in ORM. Again, it's not production ready by a long shot, but it's interesting if you'd like to see examples of how reflection works in Go.
